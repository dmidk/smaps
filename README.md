# SMAPS
SMAPS (SMArtphone Pressure System) is a framework for collecting and processing pressure data from smartphones for use in numerical weather prediction models.

Both an **iOS** and **Android** version is maintained. The logic for both versions is the same, but of course the code differs. (*Currently only the **iOS** version is available*)

The framework is included into apps to collect pressure information to make better weather forecasts.

## Installation
For installation instructions see the `ios` and `android` directories respectively.
The framework itself is called **smaps**, but comes also with a simple app to show how to install and initialise the **smaps** framework.
